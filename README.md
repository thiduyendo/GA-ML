# IMPROVED PREDICTION OF THE MGMT METHYLATION STATUS OF GLIOBLASTOMA USING GENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED MACHINE LEARNING
O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation was shown in many studies to be an important predictive biomarker for temozolomide (TMZ) resistance and poor progression free survival in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. However, identifying the MGMT methylation status using molecular techniques remains challenging due to technical limitations, such as the inability to obtain tumor specimens, exorbitant prices for detection, and the high complexity of intralesional heterogeneity. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a Random Forest-based Genetic Algorithm to explore the most effective radiomics feature for preoperatively and noninvasively predicting the MGMT methylation status. The results suggested that the RF-GA model achieved the high performance with a sensitivity of 0.894, specificity of 0.966, and accuracy of 0.925. Testing the model on an independent low-grade glioma (LGG) dataset also reached a sensitivity 0.780, specificity 0.620, and accuracy 0.750.
